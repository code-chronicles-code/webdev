## Main Quest: Hello World in Express
First thing first we'd like to install a couple of tools that we'll be using in our journey. To get started we'll need `nvm`, `node`, and `yarn`. `nvm` is not nevermind. nvm is a node version manager to manage your node version. `node` is a program that will let us run a server on our computer. `yarn` is a package manager to help us manage javascript packages. 

You could install nvm via cURL with the following command:
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Now that we have nvm installed, we can install node with the following command:
```sh
nvm install node
```

Now that we have node installed, we can install yarn with the following command:
```sh
corepack enable
```

You could double check you've installed all of the above successfully by running:
```sh
which nvm 
which node
which yarn
```
If any installation step failed you'll see `______ not found`. If you don't see that then you're ready to continue on your      quest, fellow coder.
